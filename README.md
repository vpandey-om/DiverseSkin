# Diverse Dermatology Images
Skin cancer is a common human malignancy, diagnosed visually. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for classification using images.
The Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset [paper](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abq6147) the first publicly available, expertly curated, and pathologically confirmed image dataset with diverse skin tones, has been created to address the limitations of current dermatology AI models, particularly on dark skin tones and uncommon diseases, and to improve their performance for diverse patients and diseases. In this project I performed an anlysis using DDI data sets. I am trying to use fine tuning with the CNN based model [deepDerm](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21056)to improve prediction capbaility.
